        <p>
          Our world is divided, especially to those who are different than we
          are or have different opinions than ones we carry. It’s always been
          this way, and the divided nature does ebb and flow throughout history,
          but our country is divided now in a way that many of us have not seen
          in our lifetimes.

        <div id="workOnThis">Let’s work on this together.</div>
        <p>Together we can create a world where kindness outshines hatred. This is the inspiration behind The DailyDeed Project, spreading kindness and cheer to all.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 id="howItWorks">HOW DOES IT WORK?</h1>
        <p>
          The DailyDeeds that we are sharing with you are an attempt to spread some kindness both at home and away from home. For each DailyDeed you complete, you can submit your stories/pictures to appear on our Sharing|Caring page (as space allows) & spread more kindness into our beautiful world. Right now the DailyDeed Project is just that: a project for our web development program, <span><a href="https://southcentralworkforce.com/index.php/commonwealth-coders/">Commonwealth Coders</a></span>. But the goal is to continue the project to official non-profit status & give DailyDeeders the chance to win prizes both for themselves & the charities of their choice. Join our newsletter for updates.

            <h2>Deborah Bastien</h2>
            <p>
              Deborah DC Bastien is a biomedical researcher who was inspired by
              the COVID-19 pandemic to branch out and learn more about web
              development. DC is an expecting mom (Feb 2022) and a mother of
              twins, Princeton and Payton age 4. She enjoys medical dramas,
              puzzles and is an avid football fan and wife to a college football
              coach. For DC, kind deeds are all about the joy you receive from
              knowing that your small act can make a huge impact on the life of
              someone else.
